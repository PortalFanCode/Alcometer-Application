    <string name="informationDisclaimer">This app uses the Widmark formula to estimate blood alcohol content (BAC) based on a variety of factors, including the amount of alcohol consumed, the weight of the individual, and the amount of time elapsed since drinking. However, BAC levels can be affected by many factors, including individual variations in metabolism, food intake, medications, and health status. Therefore, the BAC estimates provided by this app should not be relied upon exclusively to determine whether or not it is safe to drive or engage in other activities.\nAlways drink responsibly, and never drive or engage in activities that may be impaired by alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption can have serious health and safety risks, and it is important to be aware of these risks and to consume alcohol in moderation.\nIf you have concerns about your alcohol consumption or BAC levels, it\'s best to speak with a medical professional or seek help from a substance abuse treatment center.</string>
